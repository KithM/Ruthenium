## Modification
To modify the game, open any .ruth file (located in the Data folder) in a text editor and change any values as you wish. However, note that modifications could cause the game to crash or stop working, so make sure to back up the game first. For debugging purposes, you can find and see what the game is doing by reading the debug.log file. You can always delete the file if it gets too large.

## User Permissions
Permissions are used to grant abilities and commands to certain users that possess them. Permissions for a user can be set by opening the permissions start tag and adding an end tag, similar in how the Username and Password appear in the file. You can then add in as many permissions that are available in the game.

## User Groups
UserGroups are simple groups that allow or restrict certain actions performed by the user, similar to user permissions. By default, only the UserGroups 'User' and 'Admin' exist. Users with the 'User' UserGroup are given basic permissions, while 'Admin' Users are given administrative permissions, such as deleting accounts, changing passwords, and so on.
