## Summary
Ruthenium is a free open-source computer simulation game, which allows users to operate and configure a virtual system to their will, and features a collective database of users, of which can be managed and modified, hold [permissions](https://github.com/KithM/Ruthenium/wiki/Permissions), and more, all of which are modifiable inside and outside of the game, and allows the player to customize their gameplay as they want.

## Installation
<b>[Download the latest release of Ruthenium](https://github.com/KithM/Ruthenium/releases/latest)</b><br>

## Play
Launch the game with `ruthenium.exe`, select your desired resolution, and you'll be presented with a log-in screen. Two users already exist after launching the game so far: `default` and `admin`. Both of the users will have the password of `password` and will be able to be logged into right away. `default` is your basic, permissionless user, whereas `admin` is your system mdoerator, given permissions to be able to assign permissions to themselves and other users.

Log-in to the `default` or `admin` user and you will be welcomed with a desktop, complete with a system-based time, a taskbar, and a few desktop icons. 

<b>Click the Profile icon</b>. This is your current user. You will see your `Bio`, `UserGroup`, and profile picture. Want to quickly change your bio? <b>Click the edit button</b> and start typing away.

<b>Click the Users icon</b>. This is the user database. It contains the list of all of the users that your current user is able to see. If you do not see your user (indicated by being marked as bold), your user is hidden, and your user does not contain the permission `settings.see.hidden`.
