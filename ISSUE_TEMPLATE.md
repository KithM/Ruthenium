# Issue Template
This template is to help users explain their issues, suggestions, and questions as clearly as possible so it is easy to read and understand and respond with the appropriate information.

## Bug
#### <b>Answer the questions:</b>
- <b>Who is this happening to?</b> Is it a certain user, multiple users, or all users? Is it happening to other players too?
- <b>What exactly happened?</b> Describe the issue as best as you possibly can. Be concise and to the point. Do not write paragraphs and paragraphs or extremely short issues.
- <b>Can you reproduce it?</b> Did it happen only once? If not, how many times? Explain how you and others can reproduce the same issue.
- <b>Is the game up-to-date?</b> Do you have the latest version? If not, [install the latest version](https://github.com/KithM/Ruthenium/releases/latest) and try it again. If the issue dissapears, it has been resolved.
- <b>Is your `data.ruth` file properly formatted?</b> It may seem obvious, but small errors in formatting the XML file could break the game. Ensure that all tags are closed and not left open.

## Suggestion
#### <b>Answer the questions:</b>
- <b>Is it realistic?</b> Is the suggestion possible? Even if it is, don't expect major changes within a few days. These things take time!
- <b>Is it worthwhile?</b> Even though it would be awesome to have lazers shoot from your cursor whenever you pressed your mouse, it isn't something that is really beneficial. Try to keep suggestions for features and enhancements into the gameplay.
- <b>Does it already exist?</b> Make sure the suggestion you are posting doesn't already exist in the game, and hasn't been posted by another player.
- <b>Is it short and sweet or extensively detailed?</b> Unlike bugs, suggestions can be as detailed into their additions and changes. However, understand that the amount of work needed to implement the suggestion is based on how much you wish to change. If your suggestion involved multiple different changes, post unique suggestions, as packing everything into a single suggestion could bore and confuse readers with what you want.
